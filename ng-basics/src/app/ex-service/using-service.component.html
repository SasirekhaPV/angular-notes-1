            <p>Service is a simple class, which acts as a reusable data access point. </p>
            <p>* Define class service with annotation '@Injectable', define 
               the service methods inside this class. (my-list.service.ts)</p>    
            <p>* In the component, set the attribute 'providers' of the @component
               annotation with the value of the service. Then inject the service
                in the component constructor and use his methods inside 
                the component. (using-service.component.ts)</p>
            <p>* we can also declare them in the providers array of the module.</p>
